Hi, thanks for wanting to know more about what I'm about! You have reached my little page of ramblings.  I like talking about wine a lot, so this is my outlet/journey of diving even deeper into it, while grokking tech-related concepts along the way regarding my day-job of software development.

You can view my resume/CV [here](/resume/) if you're interested in learning about that.

You can also read my [blog](/) if you're interested in learning more about what I like to ramble about.

You can reach out to [me](mailto:chen.wayne@outlook.com) if you want to know more.
