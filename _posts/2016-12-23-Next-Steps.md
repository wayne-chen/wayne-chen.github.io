As my WSET Level 3 retake finally came to a close, I began to realize what would be next up for me.  All of those hours of studying felt rigorous but almost natural in a way.  I feel like now I'm still working at a pace where there is, or should be, time allocated to studying about something every day.  This gap in my daily routine should be filled with another wine education track, which I'm contemplating now, but time could obviously be spent elsewhere.  I would love to be able to pick up some of my side projects again that I spent programming (e.g. some audio-related ideas I had).  I'm stuck with indecision on this, but I believe things might work themselves out.

My other friend that I spent a lot of time studying for the WSET Level 3 theory portion with is also interested in taking the WSET diploma course.  He thinks that he hasn't gotten the full enrichment that the WSET organization can provide for him.  On the other hand, I feel as though there is an aspect of the diploma course that I may not be interested in.  The first unit, "Global Business of Alcoholic Beverages", does not interest me at all (because I'm not part of the wine trade).  However, all of the other units interest me.  In due time, I'll make a decision on whether or not the pros outweigh the cons.
