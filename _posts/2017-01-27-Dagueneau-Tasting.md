I went to visit Solano Cellars for the first time to meet up with a friend.  He invited me to taste at Solano for these Dagueneau wines last week.  This was the first time I also tasted any of Dagueneau's wines - boy, I was in for a treat.

To provide some backstory to Dageueneau: Didier Dagueneau was a maverick winemaker who was located in the Loire Valley, whose wines made from Sauvignon Blanc garnered a "cult following" due to their uniqueness.  According to [Beaune Imports](http://www.beauneimports.com/retail/producer_detail.php?producer_id=15), they describe Didier as one of the few winemakers in history that was a bullish renegade who took risks and even referring to the appellation on their wines as "Blanc Fumé de Pouilly".  I have never seen another wine besides Dagueneau's from Pouilly-Fumé label the appellation in that way.  This in itself seems like he's pushing things to the more arcane and original or moving for something radical and different.  In any case, his wines were something to behold during this tasting.

__2014 Blanc Fumé de Pouilly__

This wine was the first I tried.  Honestly, what really appealed to me first was the fact that it was Sauvignon Blanc.  I could have mistaken it for one of those random indigenous grapes of somewhere in Italy or the pure varietal expression for Sauvignon Blanc with perfect winemaking skill to allow the grape to manifest itself.  On the palate, the wine was rich with fresh orchard fruit, gooseberry, delicate white flowers (elderflower), a softly steamed green bell pepper, fresh grass, and hints of vanilla with cedar.  The nose also included a hint of petrol.  The most important thing to note about this wine on the palate for me was that all of these flavors were in really good balance.  The flavors were also in harmony with each other, making the label on the bottle very fitting in my opinion to what the wine was offering.  (Or maybe this was just the power of visual suggestion! In any case, I was sold.)

The second wine was richer on the palate with this protruding minerality that included flint and crushed rock. The wine was also notably more floral and had a larger amount of nuanced baking spices.  Not a wine I was really enjoying.

__2014 Silex__

This wine was even more nuanced and complex than the two wines preceding it.  This wine had more fruit on the nose - including apricot, peach, green apple skin, asian pear, and lemon pith.  On the palate, the wine was balanced and had a creamy texture.  There were also hints of chocolate, cedar, fresh grass, and crushed rock/sand.  Apparently, this wine is named Silex on the label due to the grapes grown on silex (aka flint).  This wine was my favorite out of all of the wines in the tasting due to its complexity and balance.

__2014 Buisson Renard__

The last wine had the most prominent minerality and had the best balance out of all of the wines.  This wine was not ready to drink now, but instead needed some age.  It was very green on the nose.  I think this wine will need to be cellared for around 10 years to mature before opening back up again.  Also, this wine was the most expensive out of the flight!  No surprise there.

### Closing thoughts

Honestly, I was blown away with how Sauvignon Blanc could be such a good representative for expressing terroir.  Since Didier Dagueneau died in 2008 (RIP), his son Benjamin took over the domaine and made all of the wines I tasted.  I had never heard of Sauvignon Blanc seeing new/used oak for such long periods of time, much less fermented in new oak barrels then seeing more oak during maturation for at least 18 months.  All of the wines saw oak for at least 18 months, and it clearly shows because of the body matching with the alcohol.  The acidity rounds out but still lingers since Sauvignon Blanc is a grape variety that can retain its searing acidity very well in the Loire Valley.  I'm glad I got the chance to taste these wines immediately after their release.
