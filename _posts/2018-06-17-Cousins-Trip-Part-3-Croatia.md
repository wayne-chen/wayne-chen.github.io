DAY 0
-----

The flight to SPL from FLR wasn't too bad.  We arrived in the morning to town after a shuttle bus ride from the airport to our Airbnb.  Our check-in was at 2PM but were able to put down our luggage in the room at 10AM.  We arrived around 8:30AM in town, so we picked up some sunscreen and breakfast on our way to the house.  After finding a place nearby to sit down, I ate a really dry sandwich that I got from a café on the way.  Our sail was to start the following day, so we had a whole day to explore.  After eating and chatting a little bit, we made our way to the Airbnb.  We were greeted by Ivana (the owner) when we arrived, and she said her previous guests checked out before 10 so we lucked out in being able to check in at 10AM.  The first thing I noticed once I got there was that there was air conditioning.  It felt so much better in there than outside in the uncomfortable heat with my heavy clothes I wore to lighten the load of my luggage for the airport.  It felt fairly home-y as well.  Everyone was really tired because we didn't sleep much the night before (maybe 6 hours or so), so one of my cousins and I took a nap just to make up for some lost sleep.  My sister and other cousins went out to the old town to do some exploring while we were resting.  Once I awoke, I realized that I napped for 4 hours (I never nap) and my cousin was already awake before me.  We just chatted while waiting for the rest of them to get back.  Shortly thereafter, they called us and told us they'd be picking up some pizza and calzones/wraps for dinner, which we committed for as well.  Once they got back, it started raining outside.  Apparently they thought it was going to rain just before it did just from looking at the overcast sky, so it was pretty lucky.  We passed the time finishing the food for dinner and playing some cards.  We ended up playing some games of Spoons, Deuces, and Uno.  Our last card game we played was a round of Uno which lasted over an hour.  We got so tired from that round that we stopped immediately after that and went to bed.

DAY 1
-----

We started the morning by packing up all of our stuff back into our luggage and checking out at 10AM.  We then started walking to the boat called Navigator, but had no luck.  After finding some people wearing Sail Croatia shirts, we found out that the boat would dock around 12:30PM, but we could leave our luggage at the boat Almissa.  We dropped off our luggage then went to a place where we could get some beverage and some shade while we waited, since it was getting sunny.  We found a bar where we got some cocktails and freshly squeezed orange juice to start the day off.  After hanging out there until about 12, we grabbed our luggage off of Almissa and waited on benches directly facing the boats until ours arrived.  I noticed there was an Asian sitting next to our bench and really hoped she'd be on our boat, because we were the only group of Asians lounging near the boats besides her.  We moved to the shade as recommended by one of the people in the Sail Croatia shirts and waiting only a few more minutes until we were guided to Navigator.  Once we arrived, we left our things at the back of the boat and headed into the salon where everyone else gathered.  We sat at a large table and met a few people (though the only names I remembered were Rosie and Tom).  After some small talk, the guide from earlier got everyone's attention and introduced himself as Boris.  He started talking and said we'd be having lunch because of the boat's tardiness in docking.  I was all for that, since we didn't eat any lunch yet.  We were served some overcooked chicken pasta, and I wasn't really loving the food (but it was still food nevertheless).  After we finished, we started marking down which excursions we wanted to attend during the trip. [insert excursions pic here]  I was opposed to doing anything with the buggies but really wanted to try out the wine tasting out of curiosity.  Apparently our next day would include a night out at a rave in a cave at Makarska which sounded very fun in my mind.  I had never heard of having a rave in a cave before, but that sounded European in my mind so I was convinced it was a thing.  We then headed to the back of the boat and played some more cards by ourselves.  After getting tired of that we went downstairs to our assigned rooms that Boris had personally showed us while giving us room keys.  We had some rest at our rooms while getting comfortable.

We landed in Omîs while I was downstairs with my other cousin, and soon thereafter, we realized that very few people were on the boat.  We proceeded to go to land to look for the rest of the group but to no avail.  My cousin then remembered that Boris had mentioned a tower and going to one, so we headed for the first tower we saw in town.  The walk wasn't too long, so we were able to do it within enough time to catch up with everyone else.   Once we got up a ways, we saw Boris, who Boris gave us a history lesson of the island.  The island used to be occupied by pirates, who lured in other ships coming into port by having them ram into underwater walls then pilfering them after their plight.  The view from the top of the tower was beautiful - we were able to see the sea and most of the port as well.  We then met with the rest of our group and went back to the boat.

After we returned back to the boat, we went upstairs to socialize. I found that everyone was playing King's Cup on the next level of the boat.  I hadn't played King's Cup in ages, though it certainly wouldn't be the last time I'd be playing it on this trip.  I also found out that there was a way that Aussies/NZers played it with card actions such as becoming a gecko by splaying all limbs on a surface, "ship comes to harbor" (pretty much like categories), or tongues (where everyone has to stick out their tongue when person who draws the tongue card sticks his/hers out).  Pulling the last king in the pile would still result in drinking the cup though, which my cousin was very unlucky in doing so right after joining the game.  The most fun I had in that game was getting to learn everyone's name as someone made a rule of if anyone couldn't remember someone's name, they'd have to drink.  We had a free dinner at night on the boat too because of the boat's tardiness.  We had spaghetti with a beef marinara sauce with salad; neither tasted too special.  I realized after this meal that Croatians might favor blander foods.  After dinner, there were some other groups of people playing King's Cup in the cabin, and we happily joined them.  They were Canadian, so the way they played it was exactly the same as how we play it back home thankfully.  I was able to coordinate which cards corresponded with which action.  We kept playing until 1AM, even after the Canadians went to bed, and so it ended up just being us with two Australians Tia and Maddie.  This was our first encounter with them, and it definitely wasn't the last time we'd be hanging out with them.  They were great fun and I thought it was a great start to the trip, although there was a lot of drinking involved.

DAY 2
-----

Our second day sailing landed us in Makarska, though we stayed in Omîs overnight.  We were served breakfast around 8AM in the salon.  I found it quite pleasant, as it had hard-boiled eggs with sausage and croissants.  There was a reasonable assortment of options available for consumption, rather than having a fixed menu.  I hung out with Maddie and Tia just talking about last night's activities, and we all thought we stayed out relatively late.  Tia ended up drinking the king's cup at the end (which contained a nasty mixture of vodka, whiskey, and beer).  Surprisingly she did not vomit from the alcohol of last night, though she did think she still felt drunk during breakfast.  She left shortly after to take a nap to sleep off the drunkenness she was feeling.  I still felt obligated to check my work email/Slack messages because I was informed to do that before I left.  We had a swim stop on the way to Omis, which I tried out for the first time.  The water felt fairly warm, similar to the water in Hawaii last December.

After the swim stop, since no one signed up for the river rafting we moved on from the island.  We proceeded to Makarska in the afternoon after lunch.  For lunch, we had a really great fish wrapped cooked with vegetables wrapped in a paper bag.  After further searching later on, I found out that this was a traditional Croatian dish.  We went into town to get clothes for the rave in the cave, as it was pirate-themed.  I was excited, as I thought this would be a themed rave.  I had never heard of a rave in a cave before, much less a themed one.  After buying a red-and-white striped muscle tee, I was ready to go.  Right when we walked out of the store, it started sprinkling.  It gradually got worse within a few seconds, and so we took shelter underneath the canopy of a store nearby.  After waiting underneath the canopy for about 5 minutes, we realized the rain wasn't going to stop.  We switched to an umbrella-covered table a few steps away and waited there for the now thunderstorm and downpour to pass.  While underneath our refuge, we saw two girls wearing oversized plastic bags over their heads from the pirate clothing store down the sloped walkway perpendicular to us.  We got front-row seats to see one of the girls hydroplaning into falling on the ground when trying to make a turn for the cafê near us.  We were glad she was okay, but we thought it was a funny spectacle to behold.  After waiting there for about 30 minutes, the storm and rain finally gave way to a cloudy but sunny sky.  We just walked back to the boat at this point where Boris greeted us and said that the storm was pretty nasty from the boat as well.

We met Tia and Maddie while we were resting on the boat.  Apparently they were sitting 20 steps away from us and were waving us down to join them while waiting for the rain to subside, but were weren't able to see them while we were hiding under the umbrella.  We went to a fishing boat that Boris previously recommended earlier in the day for dinner.  He had said the fishing boat would bring fresh fish in every morning and dock at port to become a restaurant at night.  He had said the restaurant would offer fish and chips, but after arriving we were duped with expecting any chips.  I ordered the fried cod, the fried squid, and the octopus salad.  I think the octopus salad was my favorite since it provided some sour flavors from lemon juice to the savory taste of the octopus.  My second favorite was the fried cod, since it was so fresh and had a good batter to it.  On our way back to the boat, we shared some drinks at a bar that Boris recommended we stop by for good deals on alcohol.  We spotted Tia and Maddie seated there and we ordered 10 shots of Red Bull/vodka, which I partook in 2 of.  The bill came out to something relatively inexpensive - much cheaper than the drinks on the boat or in America for that matter.  After we got back to the boat, we started getting ready for the rave in the cave.  Everyone else was already pre-gaming and shots had already been purchased by others by "ringing the bell" 2 or 3 times.  Kate, one of the NZers, came up to me after I got changed and asked where I had been beause she had already rang the bell once.  Two others had also rang the bell and we were sober so I picked up a tequila sunrise cocktail in a pitcher for myself.  After everyone felt great, we left the boat and took a group photo right outside of the boat.  We must have been there around 30 minutes, because shortly thereafter the clock struck midnight.  My sister's birthday was actually the day after this, so I wished her a happy birthday along with Tia, Maddie, and my cousins.  Bruno the bartender came out with champagne and Winnie popped it while spraying the rest of us with it.  After the festivities died down, we walked towards the rave.

Once we got in, I headed straight towards the front of the cave.  With each successive step I became more confused, because it looked more and more like a club the deeper I dove into the crowd.  I finally reached the front and confirmed my suspicion that we were at a nightclub, not at a rave.  I was sorely disappointed and I felt a little let down by Boris's description/naming convention of the event.  Tia and Maddie were sticking with us, and ordered a round of drinks for Winnie for her birthday.  I didn't want anything, as all I wanted to do was dance my disappointment away.  After doing my thing for a little bit, I left the front every so often to check on how everyone else was doing.  Tia was getting harassed by some guy and wanted me to be her pretend boyfriend to protect her.  I did my best by fending off passersby and making sure everyone was having a good time.  Shortly thereafter, I had to take a break from dancing my head off by going out for some air.  Tia and Maddie were seated at a table now and had this behemoth of a cocktail between them.  I had no idea what kind of concoction it was, but it looked pretty intense.  I shared some with them and hung out with them for a bit.  My cousins and sister went to wet their feet in the sea, in which I didn't want to join them; I was having too much fun dancing.  At this point, I just started going in and out of the crowd dancing and hanging out with Tia and Maddie at the table.  After another hour had passed, Tia and Maddie got really drunk because they had finished at least half of the jug of alcohol between the two of them.  Tia then went to the restroom and was never to be seen again until the next day.  A couple of my cousins went back to the boat because they were tired, while a few others stayed.  I contined to dance a little longer, but when I came back Tia wasn't back yet.  I asked Maddie if she knew where she had gone so she went to look but couldn't find her there.  I got a little worried and thought of what could have happened, but nothing really stuck.  Maddie just thought she would turn up at the boat or eventually so left it alone.  She went back to look for her but never reported back.  My sister, my cousin, and I went back to the boat shortly thereafter because I was getting more and more disappointed with the thought that I was misled to thinking I was going to be at a rave.

DAY 3
-----

The second day of our sail brought us to Stari Grad.  At breakfast, Maddie told my sister that she found Tia in the room so wasn't worried that anything bad had happened.  I was really relieved when I heard the news.  Everyone slowly woke up today, as Boris had explained the day before that we would be having a big night every other day.  So, this day would be a night off.  I was so exhausted from dancing for two hours the night before that it was a struggle to do anything.  I didn't get in the water again because my legs were so sore that I thought if I did my muscles would seize in the water.  Instead, I focused again on working for a short while.  After the swim stop, we had lunch.  The lucnh was a little less delicious today with pork chop.  It was overcooked and not as palatable as I would have expected - Maddie thoroughly enjoyed it though.  I started sitting outside at the back of the boat for lunch, as I appreciated the breeze/air flow outside instead of in the salon.

We docked at port and went to our wine tasting excursion.  I was really excited to start this excursion, as I had never tried Croatian wine before.  We were given a short description that we would try 2 white wines, 1 rosé, and 1 red.  We would be provided some snacks as well while there.  Boris also explained during lunch that Stari Grad used to have wine as its primary export, but an epidemic of phylloxera caused the vineyards to die off and thus cease to thrive.  After some time, the island became more and more in peril.  People started moving out of the island to pursue other opportunities and only a few stayed.  There was one person who was optimistic and started planting lavender in large quantities about the island and thought this would be a solution to everyone's woes.  The people who stayed were skeptical of his idea, as no one had experience with growing nor planting lavender.  After much waiting, the man started selling lavender oil at a premium as an alternative to the wine shortage.  Through his success, others started believing his wayward idea and followed suit.  Nowadays, people grow lavender and have vineyards (as Phylloxera isn't a problem any longer).

When we arrived at the winery, we were greeted with some grappa - one cherry and one honey liqueur.  I chose the honey one, as the cherry one looked like cough syrup to me.  We then continued into the winery where we had assigned tables to our tour group - I ended up not sitting with my cousins because the table wasn't large enough to fit me.  I started talking to the group I was sitting with, and they were all from New Zealand and traveling together as well.  After we got situated, the person who originally greeted us came around and gave us some history of the winery.  He said that it had been around since 400 BC making wine from the ancient Romans.  They grew indigenous varieties that the Romans had brought with them.  We started with trying a white - this was my favorite of the two.  The wine was of a lighter body, with acidity that was fairly prominent and a good complexity of flavor.  It reminded me of an Albariño with the minerality and good acidity it possessed.  The second one we received was darker in color - apparently it was picked at a higher brix level, which attributed to a higher alcohol content (13.8%) versus the one before (at 11%).
[insert wine pics here]  The rosé we got afterwards was not bad - I'm personally not a fan of rosé but it had a really refreshing taste to it with a prominent nose of floral notes.  The representative of the winery then came back to invite us into the winery to try the final red, in which we all left from our tables and followed him.   As we arrived, not all of us could fit inside of this tiny space.  Thankfully, I found a spot with Tia and Maddie near me.  We tried the red wine as he poured us a glass, and after a sip I knew this was my favorite wine out of the tasting.  It tasted like an amalgum of flavor - sweet spices of cardamom and nutmeg with a body reminiscent of velvety chocolate.  I was so surprised Croatian wine could taste this good, as I had no preconceived notion of how it could taste.  After we had a taste of this, our representative told us that we could try some illegal alcohol - a grappa infused with marijuana.  I was intrigued - where was this marijuana sourced from and how did they make it if it's against the law?  I knew my questions would go unanswered, as I knew he wasn't the producer of said bottles.  Maddie ended up buying one, but the rest of us just hung out.

As we proceeded to leave the establishment, I ended up buying a lavender oil bottle as a souvenir from the excursion.  We also took some photos with my cousins and me in the lavender fields.  As we exited towards the bus stop where we arrived, we saw a couple of the girls from the boat come out towards the bus stop with 4 bottles of wine.  I felt like they were probably already really drunk, so I didn't bother with what they were thinking about.  We made a pit stop and saw some donkeys from the winery that were pretty cute.  I didn't take any pictures, but it was nice to see that there were some other things to see other than plants and spiders littered everywhere.

After we got back on the boat, it was around 5:30PM.  I started getting hungry, as I had some alcohol in me and not enough food in me to soak it up.  Tia and Maddie were hungry as well, but only one of my cousins besides me was hungry in the group.  We arrived at the restaurant the Boris brought the New Zealanders I sat with earlier to, and the restaurant seemed pricey for what it was offering.  Still, I felt like since we had already arrived, I might as well indulge.  Maddie sat with Boris and the New Zealanders, but there wasn't enough room to fit any more of us.  As we had dinner between the three of us, we just shared our dishes.  I ordered a pasta with black truffle sauce, my cousin ordered the rack of lamd, and Tia ordered the grilled calamari.  I thought my dish was the most inferior of the three, with Tia's being the best.  The grilled squid was not overcooked and had this supple, tender taste to it that I thoroughly enjoyed.  After dinner, we left and went walking around some vendiing stands.  I ended up buying a magnet as a souvenir for home, while Tia bought a floatation device for our future swim stops.  As we walked on our way back, we saw the rest of the people from our boat who didn't eat with us at the restaurant we had eaten at.  I only had a glance so didn't know if all was going well or not.  We passed by a couple of gelato places that had lavender flavor, which I was sure was a signature flavor of the island.  Tia contemplated getting some, but did not end up pulling the trigger on getting any.

As we got back, my sister and the other cousins got back shortly thereafter.  They said that dinner was a disaster, as the two girls who ordered the copious amounts of wine embarrassed everyone.  My sister and cousins had to end up getting food elsewhere, as the whole table was kicked out of the restaurant for being so rude.  Apparently, one of those two girls had also gone to another restaurant afterwards and broken a wine glass in front of the establishment and walked away.  The gall on some people really perplexes me.

The night slowly died down, as people started to come back.  We played President at the back of the boat, and one by one, people started going to sleep due to exhaustion.

DAY 4
-----

The third day at sea started with our swim stop as usual.  I did not participate this time because I wanted to get some of my side project still up and running.  I had little luck just because getting a Docker image installed on a shoddy Internet connection on a boat in Croatia wasn't the best way of updating the container for an Ubuntu distro. We then landed in Hvar a couple of hours after our swim stop, while we had lunch on the boat once more.  The food was abysmal - we had some kind of baked fish that I wasn't really a big fan of.  We did however have a really great carrot soup that I was really keen on.  After our lunch, we went to town to tkae some photos from the top of the fortress that stood high on the island.  We ventured as a group of four - Tia, Maddie, one of my cousins, and I.  After our light trek up to the top and back down, we spotted a wasp that came really close to us.  I did not enjoy that one bit at all.  We rewarded our efforts afterwards at a bar called the Nautica Bar.  All of the cocktails we ordered were 60 kuna each, which I was pleasantly surprised by.  Their beverage menu was also expansive enough to the point where they had the Adîos on their 'heavy alcohol' cocktails.  Out of pure curiosity, I ordered one and convinced Tia to try one of them as well.  She had never tried one before and I enticed her to during the trip by explaining to her that it was one of my go-to cocktails for good value (alcohol-percentage-to-cost ratio).  Boris joined us and got a special cocktail he entrusted the bartender to make for him.  Tia and I were intrigued and ordered a couple as well, one for each of us.  I got something a little more palatable than Tia's, as it tasted like Sex on the Beach but more on the fruitier side.  Hers just tasted like an unpleasant booziness.

After we had our cocktails, we decided to go to get dinner instead of go to the Hula Hula Bar.  Boris recommended going to his favorite restaurant on the island for dinner - it was called Spice and the menu contained Asian dishes.  We met up with two of our boat-mates on our way there (Brady and Pickers) and told them to join us.  I ended up sharing some of my order with Tia (green curry) while she shared some of her Pad Thai with me.  The Thai food was fantastic - I was so surprised that I could get that high quality of Asian food with the lack of Asians actually present on that island.  Tia also recommended me to choose a wine to pair with her meal, and I obliged by asking the waiter what options there were to do this.  After having a light but insightful conversation about wine options, he recommended that I go check out a winery (Tomych) in Hvar that has been around for a very long time.  I told him that our time in Hvar was limited to the same day, but that I would definitely visit it the next time I was in Croatia. [insert wine pic]  We continued to think about what we wanted to after our meal, and Tia suggested that we go to get a drink back at Nautica Bar.  I obliged, as I thought it would be fun to try a specialty concoction again from the bartender.  Tia and I ordered two special cocktails for each of us, while my cousin and Maddie ordered a couple of other drinks instead.  Tia posted the first picture of our Facebook group chat that contained my cousin ogling over Tia's and my cocktails.  [insert pic here]  We hung out there while enjoying our drinks when Brady and Pickers came around to have some drinks with us too.  We were chatting about how the day would pass after our drinks  here, as the night was getting later and the bar Boris had planned on bringing us to (Pink Champagne) after opened at 2AM.  Maddie wasn't sure if she wanted to go, as she was feeling under the weather (though it was her birthday), but it was only around 9PM while we were still at Nautica.  We decided to have some of the free Jägermeister shots (though they didn't taste that way) that we were previously promised by Boris with the rest of the boat at Nautica (everyone was here at the time).  The music that was coming from the bar was starting to become coherent to me at this time, and I noticed that it was much better music than the rave in the cave.  I was kind of disappointed, but still was okay with it.

After Nautica, we moved on to sit in some outdoor seats with some umbrellas as rain started to come down as a slight sprinkle.  We were pleasantly surprised that the lounge-like seating was part of a bar, and I was craving some champagne for some reason.  I think it was partly because I was having such a good time with everyone else that I wanted to share some more beverages with everyone, and also because it was still Maddie's birthday (her birthday is 1 day after my sister's!).  We ended up ordering a sparkling rosé and sharing it with all of us who were left (Tia, Maddie, my cousin, Pickers, and I).  I wasn't really thrilled with the bottle we got, but I enjoyed the company I had it with so the experience was still special for me.  I think the most important part of drinking wine is the company one is sharing it with.  While sitting at the couches, the rain subsided and we heard some good music played from inside of another bar.  I was compelled to go inside at this point, and so I was able to convince Tia and the others to join me.  The club was located a couple of doors down from Nautica headed towards port, separated from Nautica by a late night eats small shop.  I was the only male in the group of 4 that went inside,  but I didn't mind so much.  While enjoying the music, I heard the DJ play two Avicii songs - Levels and Wake Me Up.  He played banger after banger, and we were all thoroughly enjoying it.  There were a couple of instances where some of the bar-goers were being creepy around the girls, so I felt like I should make sure I was protecting everyone else.  Apparently, I was getting checked out by other men at the bar without my knowledge.  While there, we had shots of tequila from a bartender who was performing this really cool fire stunt with alcohol.  [insert gif of bartender here]   We danceed at the nightclub until around 2AM, when they stopped the music and closed.  Right before that, I had ordered a couple of Coronas for Tia and me, which cost 100 kuna altogether.  It was then that I realized the pricing at Hvar might not be reasonable, as Boris had told us previously.

As we headed out of the nightclub, we went back outside where we found the rest of the group from the boat.  They were sitting on the lawn right above where we were sitting earlier for our bottle of sparkling wine, where we saw them last.  They were contemplating whether or not to go to Pink Champagne, and I was surprised that most of them still had the energy to head that direction.  We slowly headed in that direction as well, since we didn't know where this place was.  I was having a lot of fun at this point, as I felt pretty drunk and giddy.  I started running with Tia in that direction towards the next nightclub, but we lost my cousin and Maddie while going there.  We later found them, and they announced that the wait was very long to get in.  We chose not to pursue that venture any further, so we headed back to the boat instead.  [](I ran with Tia and piggybacked her while running back to the boat.) I asked if they were instead interested in playing some King's Cup instead near the boat, where the rest of them immediately consented.  We were able to buy some beers from the boat's bar since there were a few crewmembers from the boat that were still awake.  We used that as fuel for our game, and we struggled to stay silent since we played right next to a hotel.  As we finished up two games and our drinks, we got back onto the boat.  We all felt really giddy at this point, as it was around 3:30AM.  As we were hanging out, one of my cousins retired for the night as it was really late.  I asked Tia if she wanted to get kebab, and her eyes lit up in excitement.  We were talking about kebab since first visit at Nautica Bar, and finally were able to pull the trigger with our liquid courage.  We were enjoying our kebab and Maddie was really loud at this point, since she had lost the King's Cup and was having grappa while we were conversing at the back of the boat.  It was so late at this point that we ended up hushing her so that she could keep it down.  She got delirious at this point since the sun was coming out around 5AM, and she was raving about how she had never pulled an all-nighter before while partying.  Tia and I looked at each other and thought to ourselves that this was no big deal.  Shortly thereafter, we had finished our kebabs and went back to our cabins and called it a night as we were worried about the day after.

DAY 5
-----

I woke up after missing breakfast because Tia and I had tactically decided that we wouldn't stay up to make breafast at 8AM.  Instead, we had replaced our breakfast by getting the kebabs the night before.  We had left port at 6:30AM, but I had no recollection of it since I was fast asleep.  Apparently Maddie had woken up to get breakfast in the morning and went back to sleep immediately afterwards.  In fact, she was not feeling well (maybe because of staying up late last night) and was slightly sick.  I was devastated to find that my swim trunks had been lost the night before, though I had no recollection of them getting lost.  During our swim stop around 10AM, which I was awake for, I was unable to swim because my only pair of swim trunks had blown away with the heavy winds/rain in the morning.  We had lunch planned, but I was so tired that nothiung really tasted that good.  We started with a mushroom soup, which progressed to a heavily vinegared beet salad, and finally ended with (over-)grilled pork fillets with garlic mashed potatoes.

As everyone enjoyed the lengthy swim stop near Korčula before docking, I was still working on my audio project that I had signed up with my friend for.  I was still having trouble getting the hang of Docker, since the syntax for writing a Dockerfile wasn't the most straightforward.  Either that, or I was overthinking it and was too deprived of sleep.

We docked around 3PM, where we walked into port.  Tia was not feeling well, so she said she might not be driving for the buggy excursion.  I was excited for the possibility to drive the entire duration (2 hours!), so I asked if I could buddy up with her.  She was okay with it - I was secretly doing cartwheels in my head for the adventure ahead.  Maddie ended up pairing with one of my cousins since Maddie and Tia usually buddied up for things.  Once we arrived, there were two other boats' worth of people who were joining us.  We ended up as a total of 38 people, and I was unable to find a buggy for the both of us after paying.  We were given a quad (which I had no experience driving) and got concerned.  The guide asked me if I knew how to drive one, and I replied by saying I had no experience.  Tia scolded me right after and said I should have lied in order to not need to switch seats with someone else.  I ended up switching with Maddie because I knew she had experience driving one.  I was a little sad that I wouldn't be able to drive the whole way, but now I'd be in a buggy.  My cousin ended up driving all the way to our only stop at the beach, our halfway point in our buggy tour.  Once we arrived, I left Tia, Maddie, and my cousin to play in the water.  I joined the rest of our group who were sitting at the beach bar and talking.  Apparently, one of the people on the boat was an IPlawyer, which piqued my interest since I work in Silicon Valley. [insert video]

On our way back from the beach stop, I was able to drive.  I was excited to be able to try to drift in the buggy while hitting turns, though there were only one and two that were exciting enough.  [insert video]  I had a lot of fun playing around with the buggy and pushing the limits of the vehicle in a slightly safe manner.  We returned our buggies and reconvened as a group to see what everyone thought of the experience.  Most people were able to drift; I was proud of being able to do it with such little time to actually practice and hit the ground running.  I got a feel for the vehicle after about 5 minutes of driving it and trying to hit turns at a relatively fast speed.  In retrospect, I wish there had been more open road or a higher maximum velocity for the buggy, but I must admit that it was a very fun experience.  This excursion topped the wine tasting experience by a long shot.  As we headed back to the boat via shuttle, I couldn't help but think back on how thrilling the excursion was.  Once we got back, we changed clothes and got ready for exploring the rest of the island.  We ended up losing one of my cousins and didn't know where she went - we later found out that she went with another one of the boat's group to explore the island because we took too long to get ready.  Unfortunately, this wouldn't be the last time we didn't know where she had gone.

We left the boat with Tia and Maddie, exploring the island for some dinner as the evening approached us quickly.  We were wandering the streets and were mesmerized by Korčula's rustic beauty - it was filled with beautiful architecture and narrow pedestrian streets that felt very nostalgic.  We needed recommendations for dinner, as we didn't know where we could go besides what Boris had recommended earlier.  He had suggested that those who were interested in eating roasted octopus for the night, which could be shared between large groups, could place an order in advance for one with him for the restaurant that supplied the option.  We did not order this, as I didn't want to restrict myself to just a single option.  Tia texted Boris on places to go, and we met up with him so that he could guide us to some other recommendations he had on the island.  He asked if we liked macaroni, and we all conveyed our approval in unison.  We went to Chakula as Boris had recommended, and were greeted by this very kind waiter when we arrived.  We decided on sitting inside, as it was a little windy outside and Maddie seemed to be coming down with a cold.  We all ordered and shared macaroni dishes.  All of us felt in the mood to try some wine, since the place was a wine bar/restaurant, except for my cousin.  The waiter heard her reservations about drinking wine, and told her that they had a "natural" recipe as a remedy for her reluctance.  He offered this crazily infused grappa, which changed my cousin's mind after having a little bit.  We all shared half of the two, as there was a honey and cherry one for us to try.  After we imbibed in the grappa, my cousin felt okay to have some wine.  I ordered a wine [insert pictures here] for all of us to enjoy together.  We ordered four different types of macaroni (as we were a group of four) - macaroni with truffle, seafood macaroni, macaroni with broccolini and parmesan pesto, and macaroni with ham and mushroom.  [insert another pic] I think my favorite of the four was the macaroni with ham and mushroom - the flavors were very delicious in that dish.  We didn't order too much, as I thought I would be having a second dinner.  My cousin and Maddie were full, so they decided to separate from Tia and me.  My cousin went off to explore the island some more on her own, while Maddie went to take a nap before we continued the possible nighttime festivities.

Tia and I met up with my sister and one of my other cousins on the boat, where we reconvened to have our second dinner.  They wanted to go to Silk Street Food, a Pan Asian restaurant that we had passed to try some Asian food.  Although we had some pretty good Thai food a couple of days before, I was interested in trying some more Asian food.  Once we got there, we went to order.  It was an "order first, seat yourself" kind of restaurant, where all of the tables were in an outdoor area.  The food seemed to be all over the board with Asian influence, from kimchi fried rice to Peking duck.  The second dinner that Tia and I had wasn't as glorious as I thought it would be since I wasn't all that hungry anymore.  Tia and I ended up sharing duck gyoza and chicken karaage.  I wasn't really amazed by the quality of the food there, but I was glad that Asian food was an option.  What really surprised me was that the supposed owners of the establishment were two Australian brothers (since they looked incredibly alike) and the chef inside was Asian.  I caught him eyeing our table from inside of the kitchen and found it a little amusing since it looked like he was struck by how Asians had come to dine there and eat the fruits of his labor.

We walked around the city after dinner and my sister pointed out one of the bars that she had gone to earlier without us.  She mentioned that she went with the Canadian girls from the boat and that there was a pulley system that would bring the drink from a floor below to the roof, where the views of the city and the sea alike were gorgeous.  I suggested we go, but no one else was inclined to follow suit.  I think we all had a very long night the day before, so everyone was reluctant to keep drinking except for me.  We kept walking around and wandered into the square where we heard some live music.  It was an acapella group that was singing some Baroque chorale.  The music was in the Croatian language, but the only way I could make sense of it was by relating it to Baroque music, since it sounded so closely related to Bach's choral works.  We passed by a few gelato places after we finished listening to the beautiful music, but there wasn't any lavender flavor to be found.  This was particularly disappointing for Tia, as she confessed that she should have gotten the gelato in Stari Grad when she had the chance.  We had passed by a wine shop earlier, and I wanted to go to check it out but didn't get the chance.   I went back to see if we could go to partake in some more drink, but they were closed by the time we revisited it.  We proceeded to go to my sister's recommendation of this night market that was going on nearby, and tried many different local delights.  We tried some candied almonds, lemon candy, olive oil, shortbread, among other things.  We also saw a beehive and were helped to find the queen bee among the rest of the worker bees inside of it.  In hindsight, I wish I picked up something from this market to bring home - everything seemed so artisanal and beautifully crafted that once tried, one knew that everything there was made by hand and love.

We went back on the boat after our excursion at the local tasting and finished off the night by hanging out in the salon and having some drinks.  I regretted not going out that night, but no one else really wanted to venture out and look for bars or clubs in the vicinity.  I went to bed around 12:30AM, which seemed fairly early considering the nights prior to this one I was going to bed at 2:30AM at the earliest.

DAY 6
-----

I was able to wake up for breakfast on Day 6 of the excursion, where we made a stop in Mljet.  The breakfast was quite good, as there was bacon (though it was soft and chewy, not crunchy).  There were also fried eggs and whatnot - I thought it was the best breakfast we'd had yet.  We had a swim stop for around 3 hours today, and I had purchased a pair of swim trunks in Korčula the day before as a replacement for the ones I had lost a few days ago.  I played around a little bit in the water with my sister and cousins, though my body was still sore from dancing at the club a couple of days before.  After only swimming a short while, my body needed a rest.  I went up to the second floor of the boat to bask in the sun for a little while, as my cousins kept telling me that my t-shirt tan was exceptionally bad.  As lunch came around, we sat outside again to enjoy the breeze while we ate.  Surprisingly, we had some pretty good food - fried chicken with French fries.  I had discovered a few days ago that the ship had the jalapeño Tabasco sauce on-board, and requested some so that I could drizzle a bit on my fries/chicken.  It was a godsend, as the food started evolving in flavor to something more complex.  It started sprinkling when we were finishing up our lunch, and lightning and thunder shortly thereafter.  Kayaking seemed impossible, as our excursions for the day included that and biking.  We were going to go to the national park located there, so I hoped that the sky would clear up so that we wouldn't need to bike in the rain nor on wet dirt.  We finally docked at port in Mljet, where Boris told us to hustle onto port from the boat.  The boat had to leave the port for some reason; as soon as we docked, the captain seemed to be getting scolded by the coast guard/police of some sort.  As we disembarked the boat, the boat left port.  Boris said that we'd 

DAY 7/8

[](What makes me a sad boy is that I confessed to Tia that I had feelings for her but she told me that she's traveled for so long now that she's learned not to catch the feels so easily (which means she doesn't have feelings for me?))
