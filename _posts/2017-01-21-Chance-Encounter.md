### IMW Information Session

I went with my wine friend to San Francisco to attend an information session on the admissions and application process for the IMW.  Both of us quickly realized that we were unqualified for even applying, as the rate of getting in was near zero. As one of the panelists denoted almost like a commandment, "[one] must be part of the wine trade to join the program".

The requirements that were mentioned in the pamphlets given included:
- Holding a relevant wine qualification (e.g. WSET Level 4 Diploma)
- Minimum of 3 years prior professional work experience in a global wine community (which I don't have!)
- Complete two theory questions
- Letter of reference (from an MW) (also don't have a connection with)

This was a very sobering experience for me, but equally enlightening. If I were to pursue my WSET Level 4 Diploma, this can stay on the backburner of a possible means to an end.

### A Chance Encounter?

I proceeded to dinner at Alexander's Steakhouse in Cupertino for a friend's birthday celebration.  This was a group event in which I was especially excited for, as I reviewed their wine list ahead of time and called to have a chat with the sommelier (Serene) before arrival.  In addition, I had never really gone to this fancy of a steakhouse before in my life, so the idea of experiencing something new also heightened my captivation.

While doing my wine-related research before getting to the restaurant, I also took a look at their dinner menu.  3 different kinds of foie gras!  I was flooding with anticipation for what was to come.

Upon arrival, we had gotten their early so I started wandering.  As I entered the restaurant's large doors, I was immediately struck by the presence of the various meats that were held in refridgeration - from dry-aged to Wagyu from different prefectures in Japan.  Absolutely pristine marbelisation of the Wagyu meats fascinated me, as I had never seen such a sight to behold before for beef.

We were then seated and I couldn't wait to finally get into their wine list.  And goodness, was it a lot to take in for one person.

Since I am the go-to wine guy in my group of friends, I spent half an hour gauging everyone's palates and what would pair well with what they all were planning on ordering for food.  I only chose two bottles out of their entire list, and I thought I made some pretty good choices.  We started out with a bottle of 2012 Dujac Fils & PÃ¨re, which was phenomenal.  I thought it was fairly nuanced for the price point with fresh strawberry, fresh raspberry, baking spices, and a earthy minerality.  


After we starting imbibing in the Pinot Noir, I finally got a chance to order the foie gras I had waited so long for!  When the server (Marshall, and don't forget it) came around to take our dinner orders.  I had decided on taking on the challenge of the three foie gras dishes for my dinner, but Marshall regrettably informed me that the kitchen was fresh out of foie-li-pops.  Be still, my heart... I was absolutely devastated.  That was the foie dish I had been desiring for the most, as I had tried torchon and seared foie before.  I decided to get a filet mignon in the foie-li-pop's stead.

The consolation prize:

I also ordered a beautiful bottle of 2010 Guigal Saint-Joseph "Vignes De L'Hospice", which was drinking very well.  Meaty flavors (like a beef jerky!) in harmony with overripe blackcurrant, blackberry jam, nutmeg, and smoky, earthy minerality.

Finally, after dinner was finished, I ordered an Amaro Fermet.  This was my first time ever trying amaro - the smell _and_ taste really reminded me of this traditional Chinese ointment my parents used for my scrapes and bruises as a child... very peculiar.  After we paid for our feast of champions and my friend's day of birth, Marshall (did you forget?) offered me a job at the restaurant if I was ever interested, as he said he was "blown away with how much [I] know about wine".  I was obviously flattered, but humbled as this was the first time I was offered a position point blank with how much I knew about wine.
