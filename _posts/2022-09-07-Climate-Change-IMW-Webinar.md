# IMW Climate Change Webinar: 9/7/2022

# Jane Masters MW presenting
- Ã‰pernay hit over 40C
- Spain and France hit heat waves and into Northern Italy

# Victoria Gonzalez-Gordon
- how has it been for 
- Rioja and Rueda have started harvest
- atypical year, harvest has started 1 and 2 weeks early because of number of high degree days and low yields with low rainfall

# Rob Symington in Douro
- 30% of average annual rainfall
- heat waves

# Jane Masters MW
- greenhouse gas emissions will inevitably occur
  - how do we reduce them
  - Pau Roca, to you

# Pau Roca
- climate change is not weather
- the commitment is 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as a whole
- wine industry is trying to contribute to this
- wine in initial steps have buffered a lot of the impact

# Jane Masters MW
- Annual OIV report
  - last year's, over 50% wines of the world are shipped and exported
  - over 50% are shipped in glass bottles
    - glass bottles are about 50% of the carbon footprint of wine
       - they are energy-intensive to manufacture


# Pau Roca
- going back to bulk for transport would be helpful

# Jane Masters MW
- wine marketing might be able to find innovative ways of communicating sustainability with consumers, since that has been an upcoming consumer trend

# Victoria Gonzalez-Gordon
- Gonzalez-Byass sustainability program "5+5"
- analyzes greenhouse emissions into 3 categories or "scopes"
- been measuring since 2013
- goal is to reduce by 50% from 2013 in 2030
- there are fermentation emissions and fuel burning - scope 1
- fuel purchasing - scope 2
- goods for bottle composition used for distribution/export - scope 3
- Gold certificate from Green Building Council for creating sustainable infrastructure
  - used concrete for controlling temperature so less need for external heat/cool
  - solar panels installed

# Rob Symington
- Symington Family Estates
- very difficult to reduce carbon footprint due to indrect forces
  - a lot of it is thru packaging
- easiest and most impactful is lessening use of glass bottles
- various suppliers in France and Portugal to reduce weight of glass during shipment
- new product development of change in supply chain has been difficult due to supply chain issues
- can buy green energy from the grid with the local electricity company
- 27% of own electricity needs will be supplied by own green energy/solar panels on-site

# Pau Roca
- Jane Masters MW: how to influence supply chain changes?
- soil erosion is happening
  - soil changes need to happen because it also generates carbon footprint

# Rob Symington
- certifications are a good way of combatting greenwashing in wine and in other industries as a whole
- CEO approached Rob and basically said "I won't do anything in sustainability until the government forces me to"
- Jane Masters MW: explain "Race to Zero"
- IWCA is the first org to "Race to Zero"
  - strict requirements and goals to reduce CO2 emissions at a global level
  - "you can't stop what you haven't measured"
    - measure first and mitigate

# Jane Masters MW
- If you were going to advise a business, how would one go about devise a strategy for reducing carbon emissions?
- Rob: some wineries do not have the scale to measure or calculate
  - OIV and IWCA have tools to do this and they are relatively inexpensive
- Rob: talk to suppliers are move to lighter bottles
- still a lot of carbon illiteracy and we need to learn how to speak this language
- Pau: there is mitigation and adaptation; fragmentation and biodiversity is an asset
- Pau: this economic sector is equipped for a good response because we can adapt and mitigate to the best of our ability 
- Jane: Can different scales and biodiversity bring other ideas and other creative ideas to the table for us to adapt
- Pau: we cannot be like dinosaurs
- dinosaurs = ignorance and lack of adaptation as a species
